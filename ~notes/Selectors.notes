* // ~~~~~~~~~~ Selectors ~~~~~~~~~~ // *

Why do we need selectors?:
    - Selectors gives us a place to put logic for combining, filtering, transforming and storing data
    - Computes derived data, so the Redux store state is kept in the minimal possible state

# Redux Reselect
    - Builds complex logic for selectors
    - When we need to create selectors which make use of other selectors
